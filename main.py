class Hexagon(dict):

    Represents a Hexagon-shaped triangularly-tiled region of sidelength 3 as a graph in which each
    node is a triangle and each connection indicates adjacency. In particular, this is implemented
    as a dictionary where the keys are simple integer-valued indices and the the values are sets of
    indices--the "neighborhood" for the triangle of the given index.
